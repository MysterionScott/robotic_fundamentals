%Scott's trial/test to work out the work space of a wrist joint BASED
% on THREE LINKS ONLY. If this works then I will add the remaining two. OH
% yes this in only in 2 dimensions. I'm just trying sh*t out to get a feel
% for it.


L1 = 10;  % Length of the first link (base)
L2 = 7;   % Length of the second link 
L3 = 5;   % Length of the third link 

% Change this to degrees (in next attempt)
theta1_range = linspace(-pi, pi, 20);    % Base joint range (rotation around Z)
theta2_range = linspace(-pi/4, pi/4, 20);
theta3_range = linspace(-pi/4, pi/4, 20); 

% Initialize arrays to store the wrist positions
workspace_points = [];


for theta1 = theta1_range
    for theta2 = theta2_range
        for theta3 = theta3_range
            
            % Transformation Matrices time, oh yes baby!!
            
            % Base rotation around Z-axis (theta1)
            T01 = [cos(theta1), -sin(theta1), 0, 0;
                   sin(theta1), cos(theta1),  0, 0;
                   0,           0,           1, 0;
                   0,           0,           0, 1];
               
            % Shoulder rotation around Y-axis (theta2)
            T12 = [cos(theta2), 0, sin(theta2), 0;
                   0,           1, 0,           0;
                  -sin(theta2), 0, cos(theta2), L1;
                   0,           0, 0,           1];
            
            % Elbow rotation around Y-axis (theta3)
            T23 = [cos(theta3), 0, sin(theta3), 0;
                   0,           1, 0,           0;
                  -sin(theta3), 0, cos(theta3), L2;
                   0,           0, 0,           1];
            
            % Wrist position relative to the elbow joint
            T3wrist = [1, 0, 0, L3;
                       0, 1, 0, 0;

                       0, 0, 0, 1];
            
            % Combined 
            T0wrist = T01 * T12 * T23 * T3wrist;
            
            % Is this right???
            wrist_position = T0wrist(1:3, 4);
            
            % Store the wrist position for workspace plotting
            workspace_points = [workspace_points; wrist_position'];
        end
    end
end

% Plot workspace
figure;
scatter3(workspace_points(:,1), workspace_points(:,2), workspace_points(:,3), '.');
title('Workspace of the Wrist Joint');
xlabel('X-axis');
ylabel('Y-axis');
zlabel('Z-axis');
axis equal;
grid on;

%Code seems to work!!! OK, lets try in 3D. Fingers crossed
